= P4Ruby -- Ruby interface to the Perforce API

This is only an installer for the P4Ruby package by Perforce Software.

== Install

  % gem install p4ruby

Or if you are installing from the regular (non-gem) package,

  % ruby install.rb

This installer downloads P4Ruby and the Perforce API, compiles P4Ruby,
and installs it.  On Windows the Perforce P4Ruby Windows installer is
downloaded and executed instead.  Some options are available,

  % ruby install.rb --help

  Usage: ruby install.rb [options]
    --version NN.N       Version to download, e.g. 08.1. Default finds latest.
    --list-versions      List available versions.
    --platform PLATFORM  Perforce-named platform to download. Default guesses.
    --list-platforms     List available platforms for the given version.
    --gem                Gem configuration (for the gem installer).
    --uninstall          Uninstall.
    --local              Use the files in work/distfiles (manual download).
